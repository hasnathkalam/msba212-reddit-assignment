## Assignment Overview
This project builds a Python-based Reddit data collection pipeline using the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library. 
It connects to the Reddit API, retrieves “hot” and keyword-searched posts from Netflix-related subreddits, 
cleans the data, and exports it as a CSV file. The work demonstrates secure API integration, data wrangling, 
and basic automation for social media analytics.

## Learning Objectives
- Use environment variables to securely manage Reddit API credentials.  
- Apply object-oriented programming for modular code design.  
- Collect, process, and clean Reddit data using PRAW and pandas.  
- Export structured data for future analysis.  
- Document and manage code using Google Colab and GitHub.
